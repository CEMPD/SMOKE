# The format of the following packets allows boolean AND and OR conditions. 
#    Each row in the packet is an OR condition.  Within each OR, one can define 
#    AND conditions.  There is no limit to the number of ANDs and ORs.

# Specify the criteria for assigning groups of sources in the inventory.
# This section is optional.
# Groups are automatically created for sources at the same plant with
#    the same stack parameters.
# Source groups will have their emissions added for the purposes of evaluating
#    their plume-in-grid (PinG) and elevated status, and will be output as
#    a single record in the STACK_GROUPS and PING emissions files for CMAQ.
# This example indicates to group all records with stack heights that are within
#    plus or minus 2 meters and have stack diameters that are within plus or
#    minus 1 meter.

# Specify the criteria for PinG sources. This section is optional.
# The emissions values are computed from the day-specific data. The maximum
#    emissions values across all of the days provided are used.  The "day"
#    for each source is treated in local time for that source.
# This example will select all sources or source groups with:
#     - The TOP 60 NOX emissions sources 

/SPECIFY PING/
NOX TOP 60

# Specify criteria for elevated sources. This section is optional.
# Here, the non-PinG elevated sources are specified.  A source is
#    either a PinG source, an elevated source, or a layer-1 source. Although
#    all sources can be treated as potentially elevated by SMOKE for CMAQ, we
#    have maintained this capability for supporting UAM, CAMx, and REMSAD, 
#    which require than certain sources get flagged for treatment as elevated.
# In this example, the following criteria are used to select elevated sources:
#     - The Briggs analytical plume rise assuming default met conditions is
#       greater than or equal to 150. meters (this is the same as the "CUTOFF" 
#       approach in previous versions of SMOKE and the approach used in EPS2.0)
#     - OR the stack height is greater or equal to than 60. meters
#     - OR the stack gas exit velocity is greater than 70 m/s
