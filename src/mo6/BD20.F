C  Changes: (Last change first) 
C 
C 
C  30 Nov 00 @EPA-djb Bug 305, Corrected VCOUNT values for the 1983 and 
C            1995 calendar years for LDT4 (V06COU). 
C  12 Sep 00 @EPA-djb Bug 237, Initialized GLVMTMIX. 
C  07 Apr 00 @EPA-djb Replaced AMAR, JULMYR and VCOUNT arrays with 
C                     final numbers and added VMTUSR array initialization. 
C   2 Feb 00 @DynTel-ddj 1-032  Changed LDDT to LDDT12 and created 
C            LDDT34 by copying LDDT12 data to place holder for 
C            vehicle type 28. 
C  22 Oct 98 @DynTel-HXQ 2-680 replace the vtcomml bus data with the school bus data. 
C  11 Aug 98 @DynTel-MLA 2-000  Changed HDG and HDD names to conform to 
C            new naming conventions. 
C  20 Nov 96 DynTel@MLA 2-226 Expanded the arrays to accomodate the new Heavy 
C            Duty Gasoline, Heavy Duty Diesel, and LDGT vehicle categories. 
C 
C   7 Apr 97 DynTel@MLA 2-226  Expanded all the arrays - AMAR, JULMYR, REGMIX, 
C            TFNORM, VCOUNT, and VMTMIX - to accomodate the new BUS vehicle 
C            types. 
C 
C  23 Jul 98 @DynTel-MLA 2-000  Changed LDGT names to conform to 
C            certification naming conventions.
