C.........   The variables in this include file are for defining the widths
C            of character strings in SMOKE that are used for variables that
C            are source characteristics. They are all declared as private
C            so that, for instance, several modules used in the same program
C            can all include this file without duplicate declaration errors
C            during compilation.
