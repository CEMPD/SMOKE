C  Notes:
C
C  BD04 was modified to include kinked EFs for LDGT in MOBILE5.
C
C  Modified on 11-16-93 by TMM@ARC per EPA request #2-356 to correct
C    one ZML value for LDGV HC at low and high altitude. The value was
C    changed from 0.184 to 0.185.
C
C  22 Jun 95 @ CSC-mla Req. 2-502 - Changed Zero Mile Levels for HDDV NOx
C  for 1990, 1991-1997, 1998-2000, and 2001-2020 (high and low altitude).

C
C  Hardcoded FTP ER equation zero mile levels and deterioration (per 10000
C  miles) rates are blocked by vehicle class.  Within each block, the
C  continuation code is the pollutant type: H = HC, C = CO and N = NOx.
C  There are up to 2 lines and 20 cases per pollutant per vehicle class per
C  region per equation parameter.
