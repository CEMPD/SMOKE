C
C  Common block dictionary:
C
C   Name   Type             Description
C  ------  ----  -------------------------------------------------
C  /RUNLS1/:
C
C  TLEMI    R    g/mi running loss emissions, by trip length, RVP, temperature,
C                MYG and vehicle class
C  TLVMT    R    Urban type normalized %VMT by trip length (driving cycle case)
C  TLVMTU   R    user input %VMT trip length values; must sum to 1.0.
C  MAXTL    I    maximum number of trip length cases
C
C  /RUNLS2/:
C
C  TLFAIL   R    running losses of canister pressure/purge test fail
C                vehicles, by RVP and temperature
C
C  /RUNLS3/:
C
C  MYGRUL    I   running loss emission HC rate MYGs
C  MAXRUL    I   maximum number of running loss HC emission rate MYGs
C  RULRVP    R   running loss HC RVP measurement values
C  RULTEM    R   running loss HC temperature measurement values
C  RULSPD    R   running loss HC speed measurement values
C
C  /RESTLS/:

C  RESTA     R   coefficients of resting loss equation by technology
C  RESTB     R   slope value of resting loss equation
C
C  Local array subscripts:
C
C  TL<I><J><K>(18,4)  -  TL<I><J><K> ( ITL*ISPD, ITLR )
C
C  where I = ITLT, J = IGTL and K = IVTL
C
C  RULB1<K>(4,4,4)  -  RULB1<K> ( ITLR, ITLT, IGTL )
C
C  where K = IVTL
C
C  Local array dictionary:
C
C  The TL<I><J><K> arrays are the IGTL x IVTL subsets (16) of the
C  by trip length running loss emission impact rates stored in TLEMI,
C  broken out into the four temperature groups also for MOBILE4.1:
C
C  TLEMI(1,1,1,<I>,<J>,<K>) EQU to TL<I><J><K>(1,1,1)
C
C  Notes:
C
C  Composite emission factors arrays RULBAS, RULCAN and RULCAP removed
C  and trip-length based versions in TLEMI, TLCAN, and TLCAP activated
C  for use in new version of RULOSS implemented in MOBILE4.1, v.D02.
C  Added /RESTLS/ for resting loss HC calculations for MOBILE4.1, vD03
C  Combined /RUNLS4/ and /RUNLS5/ to replace old /RUNLS3/ in vD03.
C  Replaced TLCAN and TLCAP with TLFAIL associated with new evap. code
C  in MOBILE4.1,vD05.  Also, for TLEMI only the first 2 MYGs are used.
C  RULOSS code now uses TLFAIL for precontrolled group (group 1.)
C  Updated on December 7, 1992 to handle two roundoff errors.
