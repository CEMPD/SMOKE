C  MOBILE5 Processes the California Emission Standards for
C  the LEV, Low Emission Vehicles.
C
C  Hardcoded FTP ER equation zero mile levels and deterioration (per 10000
C  miles) rates are blocked by vehicle class.  Within each block, the
C  continuation code is the pollutant type: H = HC, C = CO and N = NOx.
C  There are up to 2 lines and 20 cases per pollutant per vehicle class per
C  region per equation parameter.
