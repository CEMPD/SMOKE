     Program TMPBIO, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program TMPBIO takes postprocessed MM5 meteorology and 
     normalized gridded emissions from RAWBIO or GRDBIO, and 
     produces time stepped gridded speciated biogenic 
     emissions. It optionally takes is a gridded winter-summer
     designation to apply winter and summer emission factors by
     grid cell.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
