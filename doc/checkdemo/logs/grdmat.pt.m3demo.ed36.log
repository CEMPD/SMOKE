     Program GRDMAT, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program GRDMAT to take a SMOKE area, mobile, or point source
     inventory file, gridding surrogates,  surrogate cross-
     reference, and an optional link definitions file, and produce
     a SMOKE gridding matrix for a grid defined at run time. For
     mobile sources, an "ungridding" matrix is also created to
     allow the use of gridded temperature data in assigning
     factors to mobile sources.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
