     Program SMKREPORT, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program SMKREPORT to take any combination of SMOKE intermed-
     iate files (but at least an inventory file) and generate
     one or more user-defined reports in any combination of output
     files.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
