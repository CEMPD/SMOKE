     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program PREMOBL to input gridded, time-dependent temperature
     data, an emission factors cross-reference, and an ungridding
     matrix. Program determines the minimum and maximum 
     temperatures per day for each source and for each emission
     factor.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
