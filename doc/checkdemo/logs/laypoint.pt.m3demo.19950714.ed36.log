     Program LAYPOINT, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program LAYPOINT to take a SMOKE point source inventory file
     and dot- and cross-point meteorology files and construct a
     point source layer fractions matrix for all selected hours
     and an optional report of plume exceeding a user-defined
     layer number. The program uses a Briggs method that has been
     adapted for multiple layers. 
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
