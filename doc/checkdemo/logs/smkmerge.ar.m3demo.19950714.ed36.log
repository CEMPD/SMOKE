     Program SMKMERGE, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program SMKMERGE to merge the inventory or hourly emission
     files with gridding matrices and with optionally any
     combination of speciation matrices, multiplicative control
     matrices, additive control matrices, or reactivity control
     matrices. The program can operate on one to four source 
     categories (area, biogenic, mobile, or point sources), or any
     combination of these.  Gridded and/or state reports and/or
     county reports can be written from this program. If a layer-
     fractions file is input, then the total emissions output file
     is three-dimensional.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
