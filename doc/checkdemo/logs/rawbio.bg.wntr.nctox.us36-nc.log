     Program RAWBIO, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program RAWBIO uses the biogenic emission factors, and
     either:
        1) county-level biogenic land use data and gridding
           surrogate factors, or
        2) gridded biogenic land use data
     to produce gridded normalized biogenic emissions.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
