     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program TEMPORAL to take a SMOKE area, mobile, or point
     source inventory file, a temporal profiles file, a temporal
     cross-reference file, an optional SMOKE day-specific file, 
     and an optional SMOKE hour-specific point source file, and
     produce hourly low-level and optionally hourly elevated point
     source emissions for the requested episode.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
