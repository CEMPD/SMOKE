     Program SPCMAT, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program SPCMAT to take a SMOKE area, mobile, or point source
     inventory file, a speciation profiles file, a speciation
     cross-reference file, an optional pollutant-to-pollutant,
     conversion file, and produce mass-based and/or mole-based
     SMOKE speciation matrices for all inventory pollutants
     using run-time defined combinations of pollutants and model
     species. The output species are defined at run time by the
     speciation profiles file, permitting support of any chemical
     mechanism.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
