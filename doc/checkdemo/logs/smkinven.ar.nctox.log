     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program SMKINVEN to take ASCII area or point source files
     in IDA, EPS2, EMS-95, or SMOKE list format, or mobile files
     in IDA format, and produce the I/O API and ASCII SMOKE
     inventory files and list of unique SCCs in the inventory.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
