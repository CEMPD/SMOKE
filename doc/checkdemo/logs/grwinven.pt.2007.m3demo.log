     Program GRWINVEN, Version $
     Online documentation 
         http://www.emc.mcnc.org/products/smoke           
      
     Program GRWINVEN reads a SMOKE area, mobile, or point source
     inventory file and one or more control and/or projection
     files, applies the controls and projections to the inventory,
     and writes out a new SMOKE inventory file and/or an IDA-
     formatted inventory file.
      
      
     You will need to enter the logical names for the input and
     output files (and to have set them prior to program start,
     using "setenv <logicalname> <pathname>").
      
     You may use END_OF-FILE (control-D) to quit the program
     during logical-name entry. Default responses are given in
     brackets [LIKE THIS] and can be accepted by hitting the
     <RETURN> key.
