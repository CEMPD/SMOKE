Warning about data provided
---------------------------
The area and point source files are the latest data from the 1996 NET
inventory. The mobile data are *not* the 1996 NET inventory, and should be
considered only a sample data set for testing Smkreport. The supporting data
sets that were used for creating the SMOKE intermediate files are not the final
supporting datasets to be released with the NET inventory, and so any results
from any parts of the Smkreport installation can not be considered official NET
1996 modeling inputs.

Overview
--------
The tar files smkreport.beta.2.tar and smkreport.data.tar include the 
following:
    - SMOKE intermediate files other input files needed for running SMOKE
      
    - Sample report configuration files (main input file to Smkreport)

    - Smkreport executables for Sun, SGI, HP

    - Setup and run scripts (for Smkreport only)

    - Smkreport documentation

    - Sample Smkreport output files created on SGI computer

The tar files are not a patch for the SMOKE installation. The inputs, outputs,
and executables are not set up in the same directory structure as the standard
SMOKE installation for EDSS or Models-3.

In install the files untar each of them from the same directory.  In UNIX, this
can be done using the following command line entries:

gunzip smkreport.beta.2.tar.gz
tar xvf smkreport.beta.2.tar
gunzip smkreport.data.tar.gz
tar xvf smkreport.data.tar


Directory structure
-------------------
Once the tar files have been extracted, the following directories should be
available on your system:

HP_UX11f90/ : HP Smkreport executable
IRIXn32f90/ : SGI Smkreport executable
SunOS5f90/  : Sun Smkreport executable
doc/        : documentation
inputs/     : input files for Smkreport  
scripts/    : run scripts
sample_out/ : Sample output files from SGI for area sources

If the smkreport.data.tar file is not installed, the only files in the "input"
directory will be the Report Configuration files.  The smkreport.data.tar file
is necessary to actually run Smkreport, but it is provided as a separate 
tar file because it is so large.

When the scripts are run (see below for how), the following output directories
should be created:

logs/                  : Smkreport output log files
reports/cmaq2k/static  : Inventory-only reports
reports/cmaq2k/1996190 : Hour-based emissions reports

    
The scripts and running them
----------------------------
One script for each source category has been provided in the scripts directory.
Each script has a main script and several setup files.  

smkreport_ar.run:   Main run script for area sources 
smkreport_mb.run:   Main run script for mobile sources
smkreport_pt.run:   Main run script for point sources

Setup.ge:           General configuration
Setup.ar:           Area source input file configuration
Setup.mb:           Mobile source input file configuration
Setup.pt:           Point source input file configuration
qa_run.scr:         Smkreport run helper script
sysflags:           Operating system help script
movelog.scr:        Log file management helper script

To use the scripts, first change line 9 Setup.ge to use either the Sun, SGI, or
HP configurations.  The default setting of "SunOS5f90" is for running on Sun
systems.  To run on SGI, change this setting to "IRIXn32f90".  To run on HP,
change this setting to "HP_UX11f90."

Next, invoke the script at the UNIX prompt by typing the name of the area,
mobile, or point source script that you would like to run.

Each script will run both the inventory-only and hourly-emissions reports.  The
contents of each report are described in the Report Configuration files
themselves.


Report configuration files
--------------------------
Example report configuration files are available for area, mobile, and point
sources.  The file headers explain what each of the files are.

The sample report configuration files are in the "inputs" directory.

These files are:
    REPCONFIG.ar.inv.txt     : inventory only area source reports  
    REPCONFIG.mb.inv.txt     : inventory only mobile source reports 
    REPCONFIG.pt.inv.txt     : inventory only point source reports
    REPCONFIG.ar.monthly.txt : hourly emissions area source reports  
    REPCONFIG.pt.monthly.txt : hourly emissions mobile source reports
    REPCONFIG.mb.monthly.txt : hourly emissions point source reports

The only hourly emissions that are provided with the installation are 1-day
files for July 8th, 1996.


Smkreport documentation descriptions
------------------------------------
Copies of the PDF files from the working version of the SMOKE manual are
available in the "doc" directory.

The "smoke_files.pdf" file contains documentation on the input and output files
for Smkreport.  In particular, the file format is provided for the "reports
configuration file" (logical file name REPCONFIG).

The "smoke_programs.pdf" file contains documentation on the Smkreport program
and its capabilities.

The "describe_outputs.pdf" file lists the code names of the files (as listed in
the Report Configuration files) and the physical file names of these files, as
they appear in the reports/ output directories.

The readme.txt file contains explanations of what features have not been
implemented in Smkreport yet.


Executables
-----------
The executable Smkreport program has been compiled for Sun, SGI, and IBM.
They were compiled on the following operating systems and with the following
compilers.  All executables are intended include the necessary libraries, so you
should not need Fortran installed on your system to use them.

Sun: SunOS 5.7, WorkShop Compilers 5.0, Fortran 90 2.0
SGI: IRIX  6.4, MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.30
HP:  HP-UX B.11.00, HP F90 v2.3
