    SMOKE Technical Support and Updates
</H2>

<h3> Technical Support</h3>
<b>Option 1: E-mail</b><br>
You can e-mail your problems and questions to <A HREF =
"mailto:smoke@emc.mcnc.org">smoke@emc.mcnc.org</a>.  Unless you have a support contract,
we cannot guarantee a response at this time.  There is currently no funding
mechanism to provide support to anyone who needs it.  But, we do our best to
answers your questions, solve your problems, and address your concerns.

<p>

<b>Option 2: Phone support contract</b><br>
If you would like to purchase a phone support contract, they are available at a
rate of $80/hour. Please contact <A HREF =
"mailto:smoke@emc.mcnc.org">smoke@emc.mcnc.org</a> for more information.

<p>

<b>Option 3: emregional Listserve</b><br>
You can e-mail the emregional emissions modeling listserve at
emregional@emc.mcnc.org.  This listserve supports more than 100 emissions
modelers, and perhaps someone will be able to answer your question.  If not, at
least the community will be aware of the issue or problems that you are
encountering with SMOKE.  Please send success stories as well - we all are
intersted in new successful emissions and modeling applications. <p>

This list will also inform the emissions modeling community of SMOKE releases
and updates.<p>
