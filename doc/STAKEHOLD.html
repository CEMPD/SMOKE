<b>Description</b><p>

On Thursday, May 20th, 1999, the North Carolina Supercomputing Center hosted
a stakeholders discussion on the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions
(SMOKE) Modeling System. <p>

This meeting included several presentations with question and answer
sessions. The first purpose of the meeting was to provide additional
details to the community about the updated version of SMOKE, which will
have its first release (version 1) available in November of 1999
(available with Models-3 in the fall of 1999). The second purpose was to
describe our vision of the direction that SMOKE and emissions processing
will follow in the future.  The third purpose was to permit all interested
parties to provide comments on our plans, which will impact both the
upcoming release and the future directions. More information on the new release
is also available by using <a href="UPCOMING.html"> this link</a>.<p>

The discussion was open to all who are interested in learning more about
SMOKE and in providing feedback on the emission processing needs in the
air quality modeling community. A conference line was availble for those who 
could not attend in person. The agenda that was followed is listed below.
<p>

The SMOKE Information List (an e-mail list) was used to notify participants.

 Information List, please see the <a href="EMAIL.html"> SMOKE Information
List</a> web page.<p>
