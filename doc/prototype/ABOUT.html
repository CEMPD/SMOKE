SMOKE installation on your local computer, or remotely at

<H2> Documentation Terms </H2>

Throughout this document, there may be terms with which the reader is
unfamililar.  In this section, we define these terms as well as possible, to
provide a reference tool to help make the document be more clear and concise.
These terms have been divided by context, and alphabetized within each section.

<H3> General terms </H3>

<A NAME= "FileTerms">
<H3> Terms for file definitions</H3>
</A>

<ul>
<li><b>Description</b>: A one sentence description of the file
<li><b>Sequence</b>: Indicates the processing stages for which file is used
    <ul>
    
    <li><b>Input</b>: File is used as an input to one or more SMOKE programs,
    but it is not created by other program
    <li><b>Intermediate</b> File is output from one SMOKE program, and input by
    another SMOKE program.
    <li><b>Optional</b>: File is not required for every SMOKE run, and whether
    is it required is determined by other inputs, settings, or processing
    approaches (such as UAM or layer fractions styles of plume rise processing)
    <li><b>Output</b>: File is output from a program, and is not used by
    another SMOKE program
    <li><b>QA</b>: File is associated with a quality assurance program (unless
    otherwise indicated, files are associated with the primary SMOKE system
    </ul>
<li><b>Type</b>: Indication of one of the following types of files
    <ul>
    <li><b>ASCII</b>: 
    <li><b>IO/API NetCDF</b>:
    <li><b>Binary</b>:
    </ul>
<li><b>Same As</b>: If the file format is identical to the format from another
emissions processing system, the name of that system and the page number of
that system's manual are listed, where such page numbers are available.
<li><b>Structure</b>: The file structure information provided differs based on
the Type of the file.<p>
    <ul> <em>For ASCII files:</em>
    <li> <b>Column specific</b>: The file format requires that fields are
    arrnaged by specific 1-character wide columns
    <li> <b>List formatted</b>:  The entries on each row are arranged by 
    must be in a specific order, but not in specific 1-character wide columns. 
    The entires on each row must be separated by a delimiter (space, comma,
    semi-colon, etc.).<p>
         <em>For IO/API NetCDF files:</em>
    There are several formats of NetCDF files, all of which have the common
    feature of a header and a list of variables. Most SMOKE files are 
    <b>GRIDDED3</b> (grid-cell based),
    with the exception of the gridding matrices, which are <b>SMATRX3</b> (sparse
    matrix).  For more information on these, refer to the IO/API NetCDF
    documentation.  In addition, the following terms may be used to describe
    the IO/API NetCDF files:
    <li><b>Degenerate</b>: A file that uses a specific NetCDF file type (such
    as GRIDDED3), but uses the dimensions in the file for other purposes.  In
    SMOKE, the is often done by storing the vector of source-based records as
    ROW entries in the file.
    <li><b>Time-dependent</b>: This terms is used to describe a file that
    contains records for multiple hours or multiple days. 
    </ul>

</ul>
