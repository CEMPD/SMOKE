    SMOKE:  Introduction
</H2>

    The use of computers to investigate environmental issues is
    becoming more commonplace.  Advanced numerical air quality 
    models have been developed to understand the interactions 
    among meteorology, emissions, and pollutant chemistry and 
    dynamics.  One of the most important inputs for these air 
    quality models is the data about pollutant production coming 
    from emissions models.  Decision makers need emissions models
    with high performance and fast turnaround, so that they can
    gain insight into the cause-and-effect relationships involved
    in atmospheric air pollution issues, and so that they can 
    investigate the effectiveness of proposed controls.
    <P> 

    Emissions modeling needs to change if it is to be useful for
    decision making.  There are two directions in which these changes
    need to be made:  in the internals of the emissions models
    themselves, and in the way the emissions models fit into complete
    decision support systems.  Current emissions models follow an
    internal paradigm admirably suited to 1970's-vintage machines 
    with their miniscule available memories and  tape-only storage, 
    but are not well adapted to current desktop machines, much less 
    high performance supercomputers.  It is interesting to note that 
    the misdesign for high performance computing causes one current 
    emissions model to run four times slower on a Cray supercomputer
    than on a $10,000 desktop machine.  On the other hand, a little
    analysis shows that the computations being performed <EM>should</EM> 
    be admirably adaptable to HPCC, since they can be reformulated to 
    use high performance parallel sparse matrix libraries, with potentially 
    hundredfold or even thousandfold improvements in turnaround 
    time--to respond to decision makers in minutes instead of days 
    and weeks.
    <P>

    MCNC is currently investigating how to redesign emissions modeling 
    to take advantage of new HPCC sparse-matrix algorithms.  At the
    same time, we are intending to build a system which has greatly
    enhanced support for emissions control decision making for both
    urban and regional applications, but which still can serve as a 
    drop-in replacement for the Urban Airshed Model's Emissions 
    Preprocessing System (UAM/EPS), today's most-frequently-used 
    emissions modeling system, while at the same time avoiding some of
    the Rube Goldbergish features of that system.  (See the 
    <A HREF = "EPSDIFS.html"> section on differences </A> for specifics 
    on differences between SMOKE and EPS and enhancements to support 
    chemical mechanisms other than Carbon-Bond IV, and to support 
    regional modeling.)  Our initial version of biogenic emissions
    modeling is a more modest reimplementation of BEIS2 in a manner 
    that integrates cleanly with SMOKE and with the rest of EDSS and
    Models-3.
    <P> 

    There are profound differences between SMOKE processing and EPS
    processing for emissions modeling. Particularly notable is how little
    extra computation is required in order to model a new control
    strategy.  Data flow diagrams giving an overview of the main 
    line of SMOKE processing for both the base case and new control 
    strategies are available for <STRONG>UAM</STRONG> air quality 
    modeling in

    options for analysis and quality assurance processing are detailed
