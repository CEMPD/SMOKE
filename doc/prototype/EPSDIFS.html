<H2> <A NAME = "regional">
        Support for Regional and Multi-Scale Modeling
        </A></H2>

    In order to support regional as well as modeling, SMOKE supports both
    <STRONG>Lat-Lon</STRONG> based and <STRONG>Lambert Conformal</STRONG> 
    based grids and coordinate systems, in addition to the 
    <STRONG>UTM</STRONG> based grids and coordinate 
    systems supported by EPS.  Map transformations are handled 
    using the <A HREF = "http://www-nmd.usgs.gov/">US Geological 
    Survey National Mapping Division</A>'s FIPS 70-1 compliant 
    <A HREF = "LIBS.html#GTPZ0">General Cartographic Transformation Package</A>.
    <P> 

    Since SMOKE is built on top of a fully functional date and time
    manipulation library, and since it is intended to support regional
    as well as urban modeling, SMOKE is oriented towards providing 
    <STRONG>episode-long</STRONG> temporally allocated emissions, rather 
    than single-day emissions.  Episode length is limited primarily by 
    available file space and 2 GB maximum file sizes and by availability 
    of input data.  Season-long SMOKE runs are quite feasible in many 
    cases, and can greatly simplify file and execution management.
    Care must be taken for runs which cross the boundary
    between standard time and daylight savings time, particularly for
    regions (like parts of Indiana) which do not go onto daylight
    savings time.
    <P> 

    In order to support regional modeling, SMOKE uses a 
    <STRONG>time zone cross reference file</STRONG> 
    <A HREF = "MERGE.html#ZONES">ZONES</A> read by programs 
    <A HREF = "AREA.html#RAWAREA">RAWAREA</A> and
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#RAWPOINT">RAWPOINT</A> to specify the time
    zone for each source.  SMOKE also asks the user of programs 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#TMPPOINT">TMPPOINT</A> and 
    <A HREF = "AREA.html#TMPAREA">TMPAREA</A> to specify the output time zone
    for the file.  Daylight savings time considerations affect the way
    you must do this:  first, the user must be aware that the output
    time zone choice is affected by whether or not daylight savings
    time is in effect (Eastern Standard Time is Zone 5, whereas Eastern
    Daylight Time is Zone 4); furthermore, the fact that some regions
    (such as the Indianapolis area) do not implement daylight savings 
    time implies that the user will need two ZONES files, one for
    winter with Indianapolis in Zone 6, the other for summer with
    Indianapolis in Zone 5.
    <P> 

    In order easily to support multiple domains and multiple grids,
    SMOKE employs EDSS/Models-3 <A HREF = "MERGE.html#GRIDDESC">GRIDDESC
    files</A> to store the multiple coordinate system and grid 
    definitions it may encounter.  These grid definitions are accessed
    by way of <A HREF = "http://www.iceis.mcnc.org/EDSS/ioapi/H.DSCGRID.html">I/O API utility
    routine DSCGRID</A> in programs <A HREF = "AREA.html#RAWAREA">RAWAREA</A>
    and <A HREF = "POINT.html#RAWPOINT">RAWPOINT</A>, which store coordinate
    system definitions in the headers of their output files, and
    <A HREF = "AREA.html#GRDAMAT">GRDAMAT</A>, and
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#GRDPMAT">GRDPMAT</A>, which store grid definitions
    in their output file headers.  Other SMOKE programs pass grid or
    coordinate system definitions along from their input files to their
    outputs.
    <P> 
    
    In order to support regional modeling, SMOKE mobile source modeling
    program <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#TMPMOBIL">TMPMOBIL</A> uses time-dependent 
    gridded meteorology data to drive the application of mobile source
    emissions factors, rather than relying on presumed-constant
    domain-wide max, min, and mean temperatures.
    <P> 


<H2> <A NAME = "inventory">
        Inventory Data Issues
        </A></H2>

    SMOKE wishes to consider the inventory as supplying 
    <STRONG>column-vectors subscripted by source number</STRONG> for 
    further processing, with possibly additional time period specific
    data for back substitution after temporal processing.  It therefore 
    regards duplicate entries for a given species and source as being 
    errors.  It also subsititues zeros for missing species at any source, 
    with optional flagging of any missing species records for those 
    sources present (e.g., if a source has a NOx record but not a VOC 
    record).
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Day-specific and hour-specific</STRONG> point source data
    needs to be processed <STRONG>twice</STRONG> (SMOKE does not handle
    day-specific and hour-specific area source data).  First, each type
    of period-specific point source data needs to be fed into 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#RAWPOINT">RAWPOINT</A>, which establishes its
    standard location in the column-vector order, records its stack
    parameters, etc., and fills the corresponding EMIS fields in the
    column vectors with zeros.  Then each episode's day-specific and
    hour-specific data needs to be run (separately!) through 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#PDPOINT">PDPOINT</A>, which builds episode-long
    day-specific and hour-specific time stepped files
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#PDAY">PDAY and PHOUR, respectively.</A>  Then  
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#TMPPOINT">TMPPOINT</A> uses these as follows:
    <PRE>
read the annualized emissions vector from <A HREF = "POINT.html#PNTS">PNTS</A>

for each day in the episode:

    read and substitute day-specific emissions values from PDAY
    construct that day's temporal allocation matrix

    for each hour in the day:

        apply the temporal allocation matrix to the emissions vector
        read and substitute hour-specific emissions values from PHOUR
        write resulting emissions vector to <A HREF = "POINT.html#PTMP">PTMP</A>

    end loop on hours in the day

end loop on days in the episode 
    </PRE>
    <P> 

    Internally, SMOKE follows the <STRONG>actual UTM standard</STRONG>
    for UTM coordinate specification, that X and Y coordinates are
    specified in <STRONG>meters</STRONG>, rather than following the 
    bastardized  &quot;like UTM but the units are <EM>kilo</EM>meters 
    and it is called UTM anyway&quot; system fostered by AIRS and UAM.
    (Lambert conformal coordinates are specified in meters, also.)
    SMOKE interprets latitudes and longitudes as
    <STRONG>signed</STRONG> quantities (according to EDSS/Models-3
    conventions, and unlike those in the  AIRS/UAM system), so that 
    SMOKE internal longitudes are negative for the Western hemisphere.
    For internal use in converting between different coordinate
    systems, SMOKE uses the  
    <A HREF = "ftp://nmdpow9.er.usgs.gov/public/amdahl/gctpv2.dat">
    General Cartographic Transformation Package</A> of the 
    National Mapping Division (NMD) of the US Geological Survey, rather
    than the approximate routines supplied with EPS.  Initially, only
    lat-lon, Lambert Conformal, and UTM coordinate systems have been 
    supported; eventually, we intend to support all 
    <A HREF = "http://www.iceis.mcnc.org/EDSS/ioapi/H.GRIDS.html#horiz">EDSS/Models-3 horizontal 
    coordinate systems</A>:
    <UL>
        <LI>  Lat-Lon
        <LI>  Lambert conformal
        <LI>  general Mercator
        <LI>  general Stereographic
        <LI>  UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
    </UL>
    <P> 

    For point source data import, program 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#RAWPOINT">RAWPOINT</A> <STRONG>supports both 
    UTM-zone and Lat-Lon coordinate input</STRONG> at the AFS 
    record-by-record level in the <A HREF = "POINT.html#PRAW">PRAW</A> file:  
    if the UTM zone field (columns 100-101) is blank or negative 
    (e.g., the -9 that AFS uses for &quot;missing&quot;), the record 
    is interpreted as having the Lat-Lon coordinates for the source;
    RAWPOINT then converts the coordinates to UTM for the appropriate
    zone.  (Likewise, if the source is in a &quot;foreign&quot; UTM
    zone, RAWPOINT performs the zone-to-zone conversion.)
    <P> 

    EPS &quot;throws away&quot; sources for which
    there is no speciation cross-reference entry.  SMOKE insists that
    there be a speciation cross-reference entry applicable to all
    sources.  If none is present, the speciation matrix programs treat
    the situation as a fatal error.
    <P> 

    Smoke supports the following types of time periods for its AIRS AMS
    or AFS input records:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>annual total</STRONG>, which are interpreted to
              be totals for a <EM>mean sidereal year,</EM> with both
              monthly-activity and weekly-activity temporal profiles
              applicable; 

        <LI>  <STRONG>peak day</STRONG> for ozone or carbon monoxide,
              which are interpreted to be totals for a <EM>single mean
              sidereal day</EM>, with monthly-activity and  weekly-activity 
              temporal profiles applicable iff the duration from the
              start date to the end date exceeds 28 days, and 1 day,
              respectively.

        <LI>  Point source <STRONG>day-specific</STRONG> and 
              <STRONG>hour-specific &quot;special&quot;</STRONG>
    </UL>
    <P> 
    
    <STRONG>Mobile source cross reference files</STRONG>
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#MGREF">MGREF</A>, 
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#MSREF">MSREF</A>, and
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#MTREF">MTREF</A>
    have the AIRS/AMS style ASC fields replaced by fields for 
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#RoadClasses">road class</A>, 
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#EmisProcMode">emissions mode</A>, 
    <A HREF = "MOBILE.html#VehicleTypes">vehicle type</A>, and link number (the last 
    holding value zero for roadways not treated as explicit links).  
    One consequence of this is that SMOKE supports the separate
    modeling of explicit links in its cross-reference files, a 
    capability not supported by EPS.
    <P> 

    SMOKE data import programs <A HREF = "AREA.html#RAWAREA">RAWAREA</A> and
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#RAWPOINT">RAWPOINT</A> accept multiple AIRS/EPS
    (AMS and AFS) format input files, each of which is associated with
    an <STRONG>inventory year.</STRONG>  The inventory year is recorded
    in the <A HREF = "AREA.html">AREA</A> and 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html">POINT</A> files, for use by the control and
    projection processors, for determining how to perform future/past
    year projections.
    <P> 

    SMOKE presents a number of <STRONG>intermediate-result analysis 
    capabilities</STRONG> not available in the UAM EPS.  Since gridding, 
    speciation, and control are independent operators, it is possible
    to apply any subset of them to either annual-total inventory
    emissions or to hourly temporally allocated emissions.  This 
    makes it possible to look at, for example, gridded hourly VOC, 
    or controlled annual MEOH, to pick examples not accesible to the 
    UAM EPS.
    <P> 


<H2> <A NAME = "controls">
        Controls
        </A></H2>

    There are a number of differences in interpretation in the
    interpretation of the control factor input files 
    <A HREF = "AREA.html#ACTRL"> ACTRL </A> for area sources and
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#PCTRL"> PCTRL </A> for point sources between 
    SMOKE's control matrix construction programs  
    <A HREF = "AREA.html#CTLAMAT"> CTLAMAT </A> for area sources and
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#CTLPMAT"> CTLPMAT </A> for point sources, and the
    interpretation embedded in the UAM/EPS.  Basically, these
    differences embody a simplicity in which the control factors files
    by themselves specify exactly what controls are to be applied,
    instead of being indicators of which controls <EM>might</EM> be
    applied, depending in an obscure fashion upon an input value 
    found elsewhere (typically in EPS's USERIN file).  Additionally,
    SMOKE introduces the concept of a control-report output file which
    reports the various controls which were applicable, as well as the
    precedence relationships among them (e.g., that MACT controls
    override RACT controls) for a user-selected set of sources.
    Principal differences of interpretation are the following:

    <UL>
        <LI>  If a source is listed in the CTG or MACT packet, the
              relevant controls are applied, rather than being
              governed by paramters found in EPS's speciation profiles
              cross-reference file.

        <LI>  If a source is listed in the RACT packet, the
              relevant controls are applied, rather than being
              dependent upon design values found in EPS's USERIN
              /COUNTY/ packet

        <LI>  If a source is listed in the CONTROL EFFICIENCY packet,
              the relevant controls are applied, rather than being
              governed by whether the inventory primary control
              equipment code matches the control efficiency packet
              control efficiency code.

        <LI>  Presently, the following types of control packets are 
              not supported:
              <UL> 
                  <LI>  ACTIVITY CODE
                  <LI>  POD CODE
                  <LI>  CONTROL CODE
                  <LI>  PROFILE CODE
                  <LI>  PROCESS CODE
                  <LI>  SUBGRID
              </UL>

        <LI>  SMOKE supports new control packet categories 
              /PROJECT POINT <VAR>&lt;year&gt;</VAR> and
              /PROJECT AREA <VAR>&lt;year&gt;</VAR>, which can
              be used to specify projection factors for sources for
              which the inventory year matches the year specified in
              the packet header.  (This can be used to distinguish, for
              example, inventory-year-1985 industrial boilers from
              inventory-year-1990 boilers in making a future/past year
              projection.)

    </UL>
    <P> 
    
    SMOKE is far more thorough than other emissions modeling systems
    in avoiding recomputations during the preparation of new control
    strategies for air quality episodes (after a base case has been
    already prepared).  This is evident from the following diagrams,
    which describe <STRONG>base case</STRONG> processing for UAM air 
    quality modeling in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.UAM.ps">Postscript</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.UAM.gif">GIF</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.UAM.xbm">X bitmap</A>, and in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.UAM.jpg">JPEG</A>; 
    and also for EDSS air quality modeling in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.EDSS.ps">Postscript</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.EDSS.gif">GIF</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.EDSS.xbm">X bitmap</A>, and in
    <A HREF = "figs/BASE.EDSS.jpg">JPEG</A>; likewise, diagrams describing
    <STRONG>new control strategy</STRONG> processing for UAM air quality 
    modeling are available in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.UAM.ps">Postscript</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.UAM.gif">GIF</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.UAM.xbm">X bitmap</A>, and in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.UAM.jpg">JPEG</A>; 
    and also for EDSS air quality modeling in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.EDSS.ps">Postscript</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.EDSS.gif">GIF</A>, in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.EDSS.xbm">X bitmap</A>, and in
    <A HREF = "figs/STRATEGY.EDSS.jpg">JPEG</A>.  This economy of
    computation with SMOKE should be contrasted with the situation 
    for UAM EPS emissions modeling, for which it is every bit as 
    complex to prepare a new control strategy for an episode as it 
    is to prepare the original base case. 
    <P> 
    

<H2> <A NAME = "speciation">
        Speciation and Chemical Mechanism Issues 
        </A></H2>

    Internally, SMOKE files use the usual chemical names instead of
    AIRS numerical codes for both inventory species and model chemical
    mechanism species.   For the current prototype, the list of 
    inventory and model chemical mechanism species chemical names 
    is the following:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <STRONG>CO </STRONG>  for AIRS inventory species 42101;
        <LI>  <STRONG>NOX</STRONG>  for AIRS inventory species 42603;
        <LI>  <STRONG>VOC</STRONG>  for AIRS inventory species 43104;
        <LI>  <STRONG>CO </STRONG>  for CB-IV species carbon monoxide;
        <LI>  <STRONG>NO </STRONG>  for CB-IV species nitric oxide;
        <LI>  <STRONG>NO2</STRONG>  for CB-IV species nitrogen dioxide;
        <LI>  <STRONG>OLE</STRONG>  for CB-IV species olefins;
        <LI>  <STRONG>PAR</STRONG>  for CB-IV species parafins;
        <LI>  <STRONG>TOL</STRONG>  for CB-IV species toluene;
        <LI>  <STRONG>XYL</STRONG>  for CB-IV species xylene;
        <LI>  <STRONG>FORM</STRONG> for CB-IV species formaldehyde;
        <LI>  <STRONG>ALD2</STRONG> for CB-IV species high molecular weight aldehydes;
        <LI>  <STRONG>ETH </STRONG> for CB-IV species ethene;
        <LI>  <STRONG>MEOH</STRONG> for CB-IV species methanol;
        <LI>  <STRONG>ETOH</STRONG> for CB-IV species ethanol; and
        <LI>  <STRONG>ISOP</STRONG> for CB-IV species isoprene.
        <LI>  <VAR>RADM-2 mechanism:  under construction</VAR>
    </UL>
    <P> 

    Currently, SMOKE does not support inventories with species
    &quot;THC&quot;, but only support &quot;VOC&quot;; consequently,
    the &quot;VREACT&quot; component of speciation cross-references is
    ignored and AIRS-format records for species  &quot;THC&quot; are
    ignored.  If at a later date, we <EM>do</EM> decide to support
    &quot;THC&quot;, we will apply &quot;VREACT&quot; in the
    construction of speciation matrices, rather than in preliminary
    data import (as EPS does).
    <P> 

<H2> <A NAME = "temporal">
        Temporal Profiles and Temporal Allocation
        </A></H2>

    In EPS, temporal cross-reference entries for each source (hence the 
    selection of that source's temporal profile) are species-specific,
    and unrelated.  One consequence is that a source may be assigned a
    source-specific temporal profile for, say, NOx -- but not be
    assigned any profile at all for VOC.  If VOC is emitted by this
    source, its temporal profile for VOC will be specified by some
    fallback default (quite  possibly the ultimate fallback, which is
    independent of location and source category altogether),
    independent of its NOx-specific profile.  We believe that this
    behavior is counter-productive and lacking in robustness;
    therefore, we are making two changes to the interpretation of the
    temporal cross-reference files:
    <UL>
        <LI>  we support the designation of cross-reference records
              with inventory species 0 (zero), to be interpreted as
              cross-reference records applying to <EM>all</EM> species
              emitted by the source(s) to which the record applies; and

        <LI>  we regard the first species-specific cross reference for
              a source or group of sources as being the fallback
              cross-reference for otherwise undesignated species for
              that source or group of sources.
    </UL>

    SMOKE uses correct lengths of month (28, 29, 30, or 31 days) and 
    lengths of year (365 or 366 days) in determining temporal allocation
    coefficients, instead of the UAM practice of 30 days per month and
    365 days per year.
    <P> 


<H2> <A NAME = "plumes"> 
        Plume Rise </A></H2>

    Supporting multiple AQMs forces SMOKE to deal with multiple notions
    of plume rise.  There are two principal pathways which SMOKE point
    source processing may take:  one in which a &quot;major point
    sources&quot; file is split out by 
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#TMPPOINT">TMPPOINT</A> and then processed by the
    AQM or some preprocessor to it to compute plume rise; and the other
    path in which <A HREF = "POINT.html#LAYPOINT">LAYPOINT</A> computes file
    <A HREF = "POINT.html#PLAY">PLAY</A> of plume rise fractions for all 
    point sources and  <A HREF = "MERGE.html#CSGLMERGE">CSGLMERGE</A> 
    distributes them across a set of model layers during the merge 
    process.  This latter view is appropriate for models such as the 
    RADM, the EDSS AQMs, and UAM-V, which have highly resolved vertical 
    structure near the ground.
    <P> 

    Program <A HREF = "POINT.html#ELEVPOINT">ELEVPOINT</A> may be used to
    compute the <A HREF = "POINT.html#PELV">PELV elevated sources file</A>
    using data obtained from <A HREF = "POINT.html#PNTS">PNTS</A>.  ELEVPOINT
    uses a Briggs-algorithm plume rise calculation similar to that
    found in the UAM EPS PREPNT program's BEH072 subroutine.  BEH072
    was found to have a jump discontinuity in the calculation of plume 
    rise at buoyancy flux value F=55.0.  This discountinuity has been 
    eliminated in favor of using the Cauchy principal value, 595.0, of
    the downwind distance of maximum rise at buoyancy flux F=55.0. This
    principal value is obtained by replacing the constants &quot;14.&quot; 
    and &quot;34.&quot; by 13.8906395 and 34.22187854  respectively in 
    the downwind distance formulas.  Note that PELV is a list-formatted
    ASCII file, so that it may be edited easily or may be generated in
    a number of alternate ways.
    <P> 

    Neither LAYPOINT and ELEVPOINT uses hard-coded <STRONG>replacement stack 
    parameters</STRONG> to determine plume rise for cases where the stack 
    parameters were &quot;missing&quot;, the way that EPS program PREPNT 
    does.  Instead, they allow the user to specify the replacement
    values for missing stack parameters in the <STRONG>new cross reference 
    file <A HREF = "POINT.html#PSTK">PSTK</A></STRONG>, which can provide
    replacement stack parameters on a FIP-by-FIP and/or SCC-by-SCC
    basis.

        </A></H2>

    Most internal and output files are <STRONG>self-describing</STRONG> 
    portable, network transparent (network remote-mountable, etc.)
    <STRONG>machine-architecture independent</STRONG> files implemented 
    using the <A HREF = "http://www.iceis.mcnc.org/EDSS/ioapi/H.AA.html">EDSS/Models-3 I/O API</A>, 
    which is itself written on top of 
    <A HREF = "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html"> 
    netCDF </A> ((c)1993 
    ZZ<A HREF = "http://ucarwww.ucar.edu:8080/"> University
    Corporation for Atmospheric Research</A>).  The I/O API provides
    high-level model-oriented <STRONG>selective direct access</STRONG> 
    to the data.  This selective direct access allows much cleaner, 
    more robust program design than the stream-of-records paradigm 
    employed by EPS; furthermore, the underlying netCDF files are machine
    independent, making it much easier to perform emissions modeling
    work in a hetereogeneous networked environment. 
    <P> 

    The access paradigm for the I/O API is that transactions refer to the
    data involved by <A HREF = "http://www.iceis.mcnc.org/EDSS/ioapi/H.LOGICALS.html">logical file name</A>, 
    variable name, optionally by model layer, and by date and time.  An 
    example of a get-data request for the I/O API is the following, which 
    asks the I/O API to read the timestep for year 1988, time 12:00:00 and 
    variable named &quot;VOC&quot; from the file with logical name 
    &quot;PTMP&quot; and put the resulting data in the array VOC:

    <PRE>
    ...
    REAL     VOC( NPSRCS )
    LOGICAL  STATUS
    ...
    STATUS = READ3( 'PTMP', 'VOC', 1, 1988200, 120000, VOC )
    IF ( .NOT. STATUS ) THEN
C......... error occurred reading VOC for this date and time:  deal with it
    END IF
    ...
    </PRE>
    If the operation can be processed correctly, STATUS is set to TRUE;
    otherwise, there was an error of some sort (which the I/O API will
    describe in more detail to the program log) which must be dealt
    with.  Notice that this ties data to its attributes attributes--including 
    simulation date and time associated with it--much more tightly than
    do a number of other systems, including that of the Fortran binary
    files used by EPS and by UAM.
    <P> 

    A number of <STRONG>programs</STRONG> are available for the 
    analysis and manipulation of data stored using the I/O API.  
    These include the following:

             step of pairs of variables and for the results of applying 
             various comparison (difference and ratio) operations to
             those variables in a pair of files;
