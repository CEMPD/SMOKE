    SMOKE Known Limitations
</H1>

<h2>Programs Limitations</h2>

The following is a list of known problems with the current SMOKE model.  
There is a separate explanation of <a href="TODO.html"> future directions</a>.

<ul>
  <li>Not all error messages in all programs have been tested
  <li>The control programs (CTLAMAT, CTLPMAT) have not been thoroughly tested
      and the logic is similar to, but not identical to that in EPS2.0
  <li>There is a bug in the TMPMOBIL program that inadvertently writes
      out an ungridding error message to the screen, when all of the
      error messages should only appear in the LOGFILE.
  <li>The GETRECS QA program is not complete
  <li>The MVEHSUM QA program is not complete
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Limitations</h2>

The following is a list of limitations and missing pieces of the SMOKE 
documentation.  These will be updated as time and funding permit.

<ul>
   <li> The RAWDATA section is out of date, but all of the necessary 
        information can be found in the source category sections.
   <li> The logic of the control programs (CTLAMAT, CTLPMAT) has not 
        been thoroughly documented.
   <li> Not all SMOKE library routines have been documented.
   <li> The merge, QA, and utility programs have not been been documented.
   <li> The detailed training for the individual source categories in SMOKE
        is not available on-line.
   <li> There is not yet any documentation on how to install and use 
        non-default inventories, grids, or scenarios.
</ul>
